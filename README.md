# PortfolioPrediction
Predict a set of stocks to buy using Machine Learning

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the best stocks to buy now. It uses historical fundamental data and stock price data to train a Random Forest Classifier to predict stock price. It will then suggest the undervalued stocks to buy.

As with all Machine Learning projects, past performance does not indicate future performance. Take the prediction at your own risk.

This project runs through several stages:
  1. Acquire historical fundamental data (training set)
  2. Acquire historical stock price data
  3. Preprocessing
  4. Use a Random Forest Classifier to learn from the data
  5. Backtest the classifier on historical data (validation set)
  6. Acquire current fundamental data (testing set) and generate predictions on it.
  7. Output undervalued stocks.
